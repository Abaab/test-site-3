# docs-to-pages

## What is this?

GitHub (this website) lets users host [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) for free with a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Meanwhile, [Google Docs](https://www.docs.google.com/) is a free, online collaborative word processor that can edit files in [Google Drive](https://www.drive.google.com/).

**docs-to-pages** is a project that *automatically creates a static website* from a **Google Drive folder**. It takes all the Google Docs in the folder and splats them onto a web page. You don't have to download anything, compile anything, or run anything. Everything runs right on GitHub's servers (for free).
