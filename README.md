# docs-to-pages

## What is this?

GitHub (this website) lets users host [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) for free with a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). However, using this service requires a little technical know-how that can seem daunting for non-programmer folk.

**docs-to-pages** is a project that *automatically creates a static website* from a **Google Drive folder**. It takes all the Google Docs in the folder and splats them onto a web page.

## Instructions

### 1. Make a GitHub account (if you don't already have one)
You can do that [here](https://github.com/signup). It'll ask you for an email, username, and password, and might make you verify those things.

### 2. Click the button that says "use this template"
In the upper right corner of [this page](https://github.com/Rachmanin0xFF/docs-to-pages/tree/main) (hopefully the page you are on), there should be a button that says "Use this template".
